<b>Problem Statement</b> :<br>
Design and implement an IoT based dam monitoring system which performs vigilant 24x7 monitoring of the dam, provides real time information to the public and sends alert messages to the public during emergencies.

<b>Summary</b> :<br>
Dam monitoring and operation were becoming hot topics in 2019 due to the recurring heavy floods in Kerala caused by the South - West monsoons and water released from reservoirs. We felt that the impact of the floods could be reduced by such a system. Hence we built an IoT based dam monitoring system using components like ultrasonic sensors, temperature sensors etc. which were connected to a smart controller comprising a Raspberry Pi. The smart controller was connected to a real time database storing sensor outputs. A web portal and mobile application displayed the real time information about the dam conditions for the public to view.
